# Tools for Cardano Network Service Assurance (CNSA)

This package provides a set of tools that allow for doing network
service assurance of the Cardano network using a set of "sampling"
Cardano nodes.

# Documentation

- See the [Installation Instructions](INSTALL.md) for how to build the
  needed executables.

- See the [Running CNSA](doc/RunningCNSA.md) for how to spin up an
  instantiation of CNSA inside the Cardano network.

- Other documentation can be found in the [documentation directory](doc/).
  The first point of reference here should be
  [Design and Architecture](doc/DesignAndArchitecture.md),
  where we explain the motivations for and design of CNSA.
